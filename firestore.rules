/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for FestConnect.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a combination of ownership-based and public-read access patterns.
 * User profiles and wallets are strictly owned by the authenticated user.
 * Events are publicly readable, but writes are open and must be secured by the developer.
 * Registrations are managed under each event and restricted to authenticated users.
 * Leaderboard data is publicly accessible, but writes are open and must be secured by the developer.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /events/{eventId}: Stores event details. Publicly readable.
 * - /events/{eventId}/registrations/{registrationId}: Stores registrations for each event.
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile data. Owner-only access.
 * - /users/{userId}/wallet: Stores user wallet data. Owner-only access.
 * - /leaderboard/{leaderboardId}: Stores leaderboard data. Publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect privacy.
 * - All write operations, especially on Events and Leaderboard, require further security implementation.
 * - Read operations on events and leaderboard are open to the public for ease of access.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  No denormalization is required in the current rules.  The structure uses path-based authorization for user data and relies on request-time checks for relationships.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * User-specific data (profiles, wallets) is stored under /users/{userId}, allowing straightforward security rules based on request.auth.uid.
